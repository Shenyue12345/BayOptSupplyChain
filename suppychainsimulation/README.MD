singleEchelon.ipynb talks about how I built the supply chain. Also I uses two objective functions to solve the problem about Bayesian optimization with stochastic constraint. 

EI_Function.ipynb takes a glance about the objective surface.

New_EI_Function.ipynb implements a new constraint EI function.
