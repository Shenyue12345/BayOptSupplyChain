### singleEchelon.ipynb 
talks about how I built the supply chain. Also I uses two objective functions to solve the problem about Bayesian optimization with stochastic constraint. 

### EI_Function.ipynb 
takes a glance about the objective surface.

### New_EI_Function.ipynb 
implements a new constraint EI function.

### Comparing_two_method.ipynb
compares the penalty method in singleEchelon.ipynb (first method) and the new ei function method.
