# Gaussian Process on Scallop DataSet

# Data
The scallop data frame I used has 148 triplets concerning scallop abundance; based on a 1990 survey cruise in the Atlantic continental shelf off Long Island, New York, U.S.A. (http://matt-wand.utsacademics.info/webspr/scallop.html) I saved this data into .csv file.
